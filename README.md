# Exploring Markdown

This is a repo/document for me to keep track of my bash commands and also practice with Markdown

## Review of Common Bash Commands
- `cd`- **command for changing directories**

- `touch`- create a file **_command for creating files_**

- `mkdir`- "make/create a directory" **command for making one or more directories**

- `ls`- "list directory contents" **_command for viewing files in the directory you are in_**

- `pwd`- "print working directory" **_command for viewing which directory you are currently in_**

- `mv`- "move or rename directory" 

### Markdown 101


Markdown is a way to write content for the web. It’s written in what people like to call “plaintext”and a versatile way to share content across several devices.

Markdown commands include:

- `_to italicize content_`: to italize font put it in between "_"
-`**bold**`: to bold font put it between "**"
- to create **headers** use the `#` for the level of header you are looking to create (from 1-6)

-**inline links** are created with brackets for the text followed by parenthesis for the link: `[What text you want to appear](what link you want to post)`

-**reference links** are created to refer you to another part of the same document. 

Here's an example of the format:
  Here's [a link to something else][another place].
     Here's [yet another link][another-link].
     And now back to [the first link][another place].

     [another place]: www.github.com
     [another-link]: www.google.com

-**images** are linked in this format:

![A pretty tiger](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/56/Tiger.50.jpg)

To add ALT text for visually impared follow reference link format

-**block quotes** are created with `>` at the beginning of the quote: 

> "The sin of doing nothing is the deadliest of all the seven sins. It has been said that for evil men to accomplish their purpose it is only necessary that good men should do nothing."

-**unordered lists**- would place each item on it's on line prefaced with `*`:

* Milk
* Eggs
* Salmon
* Butter

-**ordered lists**- are prefaced with numbers instaed of *'s:

1. Crack three eggs over a bowl
2. Pour a gallon of milk into the bowl
3. Rub the salmon vigorously with butter
4. Drop the salmon into the egg-milk bowl

-**soft breaks** involved two spaces at the end of each line to create paragraphs
